# Audio ðŸ”ˆ Classifier using TensorFlow

In this project, I created a bird audio classifier using `TensorFlow`. The dataset consisted audio files got the `Capuchinbird` ðŸ¦œ calls. With the help of Signal and Audio Processing functionalities, we can extract image like representation from audio files (Spectrogram)  and then use regular CNN layers to train a deep learning model to predict if there was a call in the particular audio clip or not. 

The Dataset was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kenjee/z-by-hp-unlocked-challenge-3-signal-processing

To run the notebook, you just need to install all the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using the command:

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
